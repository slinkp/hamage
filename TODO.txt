UNTESTED
=========

* config the filter chain
  - via entry point name at instantiation - UNTESTED
  - django settings - UNTESTED

* django.contrib.moderation support - OK, in the demo app, but UNTESTED
  and it's bad user experience.

* consistent logging a la:
  "ip 123.456.789.012: ExternalLinksFilterStrategy FAIL karma -9"
  "ip 123.456.789.012: SomeOtherFilterStrategy PASS karma 1"

* dependencies in setup.py!


TODO
========

* wsgi form integration. guinea pig: the captcha/expression.py filter?
 - low-level tests
 - register entry point
 - try it on a form

* wsgi errors: better placement control. Like a css path expression a
  la jquery?  Or ... maybe instead specify  path to a form and we just
  inject at start of that form?

* filter init params in the configuration

* wsgi middleware: multiple forms per page?

* get more filters working
  - with logging
  - with tests
